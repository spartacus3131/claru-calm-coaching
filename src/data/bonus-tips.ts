    title: 'Disconnect from Productivity More Often',
    description: 'Take more breaks than you think you need',
    content: 'Research from the University of Toronto found that when we work continuously for 52 minutes, we should take a break for at least 17 minutes. When we feel low on energy, it\'s because we have a limited pool of physical energy in our brain. Once it\'s depleted, we become less effective at everything. Completely separating from work helps replenish that pool.',
    tip: 'The best break activities let you recharge, destress, and have fun.',

    title: 'Recall Three Things You\'re Grateful For',
    description: 'Train your brain to scan for positives',
    content: 'Every night, even after the toughest days, write down the three biggest things you\'re grateful for from that day—or if that\'s too hard, three things you\'re grateful for in general. According to researcher Shawn Achor, "as you consciously practice scanning for positives, your brain gets better at it and retains the new pattern of unconsciously constantly scanning the world for the good."',
    tip: 'It\'s not the gratitude itself as much as the ability to scan for positives that makes this habit so effective.',

    title: 'Journal About a Positive Experience',
    description: 'Double the impact of meaningful moments',
    content: 'At the end of each day, journal (or talk about) a positive experience you had. According to Shawn Achor, "your brain stamps it as meaningful." The brain can\'t tell much difference between visualization and actual experience, so you just doubled the most meaningful experiences of your day. Over time, your brain connects the dots and you realize you have a trajectory of meaning running throughout your life.',
    tip: 'Give these tactics a few weeks to train your brain and become habits.',

    title: 'Break Tasks Down',
    description: 'Make work feel more like a video game',
    content: 'There\'s a reason video games feel more rewarding than work: games provide a rapid succession of milestones, goals, and rewards. Most jobs are far more ambiguous and unstructured. Create subgoals for larger projects, spend more time planning to add structure, and keep a running list of things to get done for each project. This makes your work more structured, rewarding, and engaging.',
    tip: 'Research shows this also makes you more likely to achieve a "flow" state.',

    title: 'Ask Yourself for Advice',
    description: 'Tap into your own wisdom',
    content: 'One of the best ways to become more productive when facing a challenge is to ask yourself for advice. Ask yourself: "What advice would I give myself in this situation?" This tactic also works wonders for firing up your prefrontal cortex when you\'re resisting aversive tasks.',

    title: 'Reward Yourself',
    description: 'Solidify habits and have fun',
    content: 'Whether that means spending fifteen minutes on social media after a long work session, transferring a dollar into a "fun money" account for every day you stick to a habit, or treating yourself to a nice dinner when you finish a big project—rewarding yourself works wonders for solidifying habits AND for having fun while investing in your productivity.',

    title: 'Know You Can Grow',
    description: 'Embrace the growth mindset',
    content: 'According to Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, the main thing separating successful people from unsuccessful people is whether they feel their intelligence and abilities are fixed. People with a growth mindset believe that through hard work and persistence, they can accomplish more. They embrace obstacles as challenges to be overcome, see working hard as the only way to master a skill, and don\'t view setbacks as proof of limitation.',
    tip: 'Remind yourself that you can always grow—it\'s a great way to challenge yourself to become more productive.',

    title: 'Create an Accomplishments List',
    description: 'Celebrate your wins and stay motivated',
    content: 'Maintain an Accomplishments List that you review and add to regularly (like on Maintenance Day). Before keeping this list, I invested in productivity without actually taking time to reflect on what I accomplished. Reviewing the list each week lets me pat myself on the back, propels me into the week ahead, and motivates me to accomplish more—especially on long-term projects where results aren\'t immediately apparent.',

    title: 'Look at Pictures of Cute Baby Animals',
    description: 'Boost your cognitive performance (really!)',
    content: 'Not only can looking at cute baby animals make you go "awwwwww," it can also boost your cognitive and motor performance. Yes, this is real science. Take a break and look at some puppies or kittens. You\'ve earned it.',
    tip: 'Productivity isn\'t about grinding yourself into dust. It\'s about accomplishing what matters and having energy left over for the rest of your life.',
